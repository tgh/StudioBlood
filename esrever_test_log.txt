Test results from unit_test_for_run.c unit test driver for the run_esrever()
function of the esreveR LADSAP plugin.

Test 1: 0 sample rate, 0 samples
    Result: Passed

Test 2: 44100 sample rate, 8000 samples (audio shorter than 0.2 seconds)
    Result: Segmentation Fault
    Error: Unsigned long underflow
    Fix: Added additional conditional to if statement
    Result: Passed

Test 3: 44100 sample rate, 30000 samples (audio longer than 0.2s, shorter than
                                          1.5s)
    Result: Passed

Test 4: 44100 sample rate, 8820 samples (audio equal to 0.2s)
    Result: Passed

Test 5: 44100 sample rate, 66150 samples (audio equal to 1.5s)
    Result: Passed

Test 6: 44100 sample rate, 8821 samples (one sample longer than 0.2s)
    Result: Passed

Test 7: 44100 sample rate, 66151 samples (one sample longer than 1.5s)
    Result: Passed

Test 8: 48000 sample rate, 240000 samples (a normal example: 48kHz, 5s)
    Result: Unacceptable randomness, first two sub-blocks equal in length,
            then next three sub-blocks equal in length
    Error: Unknown. Bad random number generator?  Bad seed, or seeded the
               same in loop?  TEST AGAIN:
    Result: Passed, but error noted as bothersome/to be looked into. TEST 9.
    -------
    Fix: Added a better seed algorithm using timeval with nanoseconds
    Result: Passed.  TEST AGAIN:
    Result: Passed

Test 9: 192000 sample rate, 2880000 samples (a very high example: 192kHz, 15s)
    Result: Unacceptable randomness, many successive blocks equal in length
    Error: Random number generator seeded in seconds, and since the random
           numbers are generated in a loop that executes faster than a second,
           the seed is the same, and thus the random number is the same.
    Fix: Added a better seed algorithm using timeval with nanoseconds
    Result: Random numbers differ, but they're favored towards upper bound

---------------------------------------
Implemented new random number generator
