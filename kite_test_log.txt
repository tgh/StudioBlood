Test 1: 8000 sample rate, 4000 samples
	Result: Passed.

Test 2: 8000 sample rate, 4001 samples
	Result: reverse switch received a value of 2
	Error: random number function changed to include upper bound, but caller's
			parameter for the upper bound didn't get changed from 2 to 1
	Fix: changed call upper bound parameter from 2 to 1
	Result: Passed.

Test 3: 8000 sample rate, 18000 samples
	Result: Passed.
	Note: reverse was off 3 times out of 3

Test 4: 8000 sample rate, 18001 samples
	Result: Overlapping samples when overwriting sub-block
	Error: didn't forsee that special case
	Fix: added special case
	Result: Sub-blocks can still be of length smaller than minimum
	Error: incomplete algorithm
