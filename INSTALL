-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must have the LADSPA SDK installed first in order for these plugins to
work.  Go here to download it: http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html.

To install, first open the Makefile and make sure that the LADSPA_PATH variable
matches the directory of your system's LADSPA_PATH environment variable.  Once
that is good, run 'sudo make install'.  Of course, if you don't have root
privileges you wont be able to install.  Ask whoever the supervisor of your
system is to install for you, or, if (s)he's really nice, give you the root
password.  This will compile the source code files into shared object files and
copies them into your LADSPA_PATH directory.

Once they're there, you're good to go.  Just open your favorite audio editing
program (must be LADSPA compatible though) and the plugins should appear
wherever the effects reside in your programs interface.  In Audacity (the
program I used to test the plugins), for example, you would go to the Effects
menu, and at the bottom there should be sub-menus ("Plugins 1 to 5", for
example) for however many other plugins you have.

You can also run 'make clean' to remove the object files and shared object files
from the current directory you ran make from.


To uninstall, run 'sudo make uninstall' (again, you need root privileges for
this).
